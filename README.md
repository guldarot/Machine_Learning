# Create an Environment
conda create -n first python=3.10

It likely arises if you have encountered an issue because Python 3.12 and 3.11 might not be available in the default Anaconda repository yet. To handle this error, you can try the following steps:
conda create -n first python=3.11 -c conda-forge

Use conda-forge Channel: Sometimes, the conda-forge channel may have the required versions of Python. You can create the environment using conda-forge:
conda create -n first python=3.11 -c conda-forge
